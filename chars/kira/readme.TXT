1.Introduction
--------------
Thanks for downloading my M.U.G.E.N. Light character. This character was created
by me (MGSSJ2). Yagami Light is a character of the Death Note manga/anime. His gamestyle 
is unique.

Short story reference:
In the Death Note series, Yagami Light is the most smart person in all Japan. He was finishing
his studies, when he discovered a black note, with an inscriprion "Death Note" in it. This
book was able to kill any person by knowing his name, and his face. Light finds himself in a
mission: judge every bad person, and become the God of the New World, a peaceful world within
criminals. The people reckon that somebody is killing the bad persons, and call this new god
"Kira". But the police didn't stay quiet. They asked "L", one of the most intelligent man in 
the world, who has resolved a lot of mysteries before, for help in this. Then, the battle
between L and Kira begins, to see who discovers the other first.

2.Credits
---------
Here goes everything that helped me in making this char.

-Noise, for Yagami Light, Ryuk, Amane Misa, Rem, Nate River, and Mihael Keehl sprites.
-Harsh29, for Elle Lawliet sprites.
-Z Sabre User, for his Yagami Light char being hit and lying down sprites. I borrowed 'em.
-JumpSuperMugen project,for their Yagami Light walking sprites. I think this char haven't 
been possible within these cool sprites.

3.Movelist
----------
These are all the movement Light actually have.

Basics:

Attacks:
Death Note Heart Attack Kill: A.
Descriprion: Light writes the name of the enemy on his Death Note, and kills him in 20 
seconds. Preety cheap you will say, but well... Is a Death Note...
Misa's Shinigami Eyes: B
Description: same effect as Death Note Heart Attack Kill, just faster. Why? Dunno. 
I didn't know what to do with the Shinigami Eyes... You have this.
Near Toys Throw: C.
Description: Near throws toys at the enemy. 50 damage per toy.
L's 24-hour Camera Supervision: X.
Description: while L is watching the enemy, he/she/it can't attack.
Rem's Death Note: Y.
Description: same effect as Death Note Heart Attack Kill, but this one is slower and
can't be interrumpted.
Mello's Gun Shot: Z.
Description: Mello appears and shoots enemy 5 times. Note that this attack can't kill
the enemy really.
Ryuk's Apple Rain: Start.

1. Sometimes the Death Note cannot kill certain enemy... Well just start the round again,
or if you have Debug Keys enabled, press F1 (this happens me when i use this with my Link
and it guards...)
