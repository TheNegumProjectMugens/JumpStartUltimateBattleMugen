--- Party Members ---
Each party member has two attacks, a normal attack and a special attack which uses MP.  Based on the character's AI, they may attack the enemies to regain lost MP as a normal attack will regain some MP.  Party members will also level up as you progress through rounds.

Donald: Normal Attack = Staff Strike, Special Attack = Various Spells (5 MP)
Goofy: Normal Attack = Shield Strike, Special Attack = Shield Thrust (5 MP)
Aladdin: Normal Attack = Sword Strike, Special Attack = Apple Toss (5 MP)
Abu: Normal Attack = Sword Strike, Special Attack = ?
Aeris: Normal Attack = Staff Hit, Special Attack 1 = Cura (5 MP), Special Attack 2 = Limit Break (Great Gospel)

--- Notes ---
I am aware that there are a lot of sounds missing.  As of right now it is impossible for me to rip sound effects/voices from either Kingdom Hearts on the PS2 nor Kingdom Hearts CoM on the GBA.  If you could assist me in this process, please send me an e-mail and you will be properly credited.
