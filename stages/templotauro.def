 ;High and low bound of camera
 ;High is a negative number. Make is more negative if you want to

 ;Low should usually be 0.
 ;If omitted, defaults to -25 and 0 respectively
 ;***

 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the
 ;highest player. Valid values are from 0 to 1. A value of 0 will mean
 ;the camera does not move up at all. A value of 1 will makes the camera
 ;follow the highest player.
 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.
